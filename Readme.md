## Create SlackBot 

Slack application, we can use classic slack app (Not recommend, when you create too much local BOT). 

- Create a Slackbot token: ttps://api.slack.com/rtm#create_a_classic_slack_app.

- Go to OAuth & Permissions in the left pane

- Add bot scope in the Scopes section

You'll see a warning saying "This scope is deprecated. Please update scopes to use granular permissions." but don't upgrade to the newer permission model

- Go to App Home in the left pane

- Click Add Legacy Bot User and set its name

- Go to Install App in the left pane

- Run the OAuth flow with your development workspace
